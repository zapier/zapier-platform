<!--

title should be in the format of:

  workType(area): release notes summary

where:

  `workType` is one of (which correspond to semver release levels):
    * fix
    * feat
    * BREAKING CHANGE
  less common (but valid) options:
    * build
    * ci
    * chore
    * docs
    * perf
    * refactor
    * revert
    * style
    * test

  `area` is (probably) one of:
    * cli
    * schema
    * core
    * legacy-scripting-runner
    * schema-to-ts
