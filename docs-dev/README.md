# Development Quick Reference

This directory provides quick reference information for both human developers and AI tools working on the Zapier Platform codebase.

## Documentation Map

### Existing Documentation (main repository docs)
- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Repository overview and all documentation links
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Repository structure and technical organization
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Setup, testing, development workflow, and pnpm linking

### Quick Reference (this directory)
- **[install-dev.md](install-dev.md)** - Development CLI setup and aliases
- **[commands.md](commands.md)** - Command cheat sheet organized by task
- **[package-info.md](package-info.md)** - Package purposes and key relationships

## For AI Tools
AI tools should reference both the existing documentation and these quick reference files to avoid duplicating information while getting task-oriented summaries.
