Use this when an integration version will not be supported or start breaking at a known date.

Zapier will send an email warning users of the deprecation once a date is set, they'll start seeing it as "Deprecated" in the UI, and once the deprecation date arrives, if the Zaps weren't updated, they'll be paused and the users will be emailed again explaining what happened.

After the deprecation date has passed it will be safe to delete that integration version.

Do not use this if you have non-breaking changes, such as fixing help text.`;
