# OpenAI

This Zapier integration project is generated by the `zapier init` CLI command. This integration in particular is using the OpenAI API to generate responses to prompts from users. For this integration, there is a `constants.js` file that will allow you to swap out the base URL and version of the API to swap if you are using an OpenAI compatible API to get started.
