# basic-auth-typescript

This Zapier integration project is generated by the `zapier init` CLI command.

These are what you normally do next:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install  # or you can use yarn

# Run tests
zapier test

# Register the integration on Zapier if you haven't
zapier register "App Title"

# Or you can link to an existing integration on Zapier
zapier link

# Push it to Zapier
zapier push
```

Then, to add more features, you can use the `zapier scaffold` command, for example:

```bash
# Add a trigger
zapier scaffold trigger contact

# Add an action
zapier scaffold create contact
```
