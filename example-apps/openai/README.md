# OpenAI

This Zapier integration project is generated by the `zapier init` CLI command. This integration in particular is using the OpenAI API to generate responses to prompts from users. For this integration, there is a `constants.js` file that will allow you to swap out the base URL and version of the API to swap if you are using an OpenAI compatible API to get started.

These are what you normally do next:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install  # or you can use yarn

# Run tests
zapier test

# Register the integration on Zapier if you haven't
zapier register "App Title"

# Or you can link to an existing integration on Zapier
zapier link

# Push it to Zapier
zapier push
```
